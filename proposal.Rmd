### Project Title

Where the Grass is Greener: Linking Demographic and Health Outcome Data to Urban Green Space in NYC

### Motivation

Access to quality green space is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of public health in urban environments. Parks and other green areas promote physical activity, social interaction, and stress reduction, all of which contribute to improved physical and mental health outcomes. However, as New York City become increasingly dense, disparities in the availability, quality, and accessibility of parks raise important questions about environmental equity and community well-being.

This project aims to explore the relationship between parks, health outcomes, and neighborhood demographics across New York City. Using the NYC Parks Properties dataset, we plan to characterize park features such as size, location, and type, while the NYC Community Health Profiles data provides neighborhood-level indicators on chronic disease, mental health, and socioeconomic conditions. By integrating these datasets, we aim to assess how park distribution and attributes relate to health outcomes and to identify geographic areas where improvements in green space quality or accessibility could have the greatest public health impact.

Our analysis is informed by evidence from a recent systematic review on green space and health by Nguyen et al. (2021), which highlights that specific park characteristics, such as tree canopy coverage, connectivity, and well-maintained amenities, are more strongly linked to health benefits than overall “greenness.” These insights guide our focus on spatial patterns and equity implications in New York City’s park system.

Ultimately, this project seeks to demonstrate how publicly available urban and health data can be used to uncover actionable relationships between the built environment and population health, informing data-driven strategies to promote environmental justice and healthier urban living.


### Data Sources

The [NYC Community Health Profiles](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/profiles.page) capture the health of 59 community districts across the city. They contain over 50 measures of neighborhood health.

The [Parks Properties map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Properties-Map/krz2-j7bn) identifies property managed partially or solely by NYC Parks. 

### Intended Final Products and Report Structure

Introduction: This will include an explanation of our motivation for this project and questions we are hoping to answer along with possible anticipated results. It will also include brief background information about how environmental access can contribute to health disparities.

Exploratory data analysis and cleaning: Since our demographic dataset is so extensive, the data cleaning process will first involve selecting the variables in this dataset that will be used in the analysis. We will focus mostly on the variables under social and economic conditions as well as the variables under the healthy living section of the dataset. We will explore the distributions of these variables for each neighborhood and borough and use tables and boxplots for visualization.

Data Analysis: We will focus on predictive modeling in which we will examine whether social and economic factors are associated with the distribution of green space across New York City neighborhoods and assess whether variations in the amount of green space correlate to residents’ lifestyle habits. We will also include visualizations to display the relationships such as scatter plots, regression line plots, and maps.

Discussion: This will include a discussion of our findings and whether they align with what we were expecting. We will also discuss possible explanations of why we got the results we did and discuss limitations of our analysis. 



### The Planned Modeling and Visualization

Goal: Assess whether access to green space is associated with community health after accounting for socioeconomic differences.  

* Model 1 — Baseline bivariate OLS
Purpose: quantify crude associations.
Examples:  
obesity_rate ~ park_area_per_capita;
poor_mental_health ~ park_area_density.

* Model 2 — Adjusted multiple OLS (confounder-controlled)
Purpose: control socioeconomic confounding and borough fixed effects.
Example:  
obesity_rate ~ park_area_per_capita + poverty_rate + education_level + unemployment_rate + factor(borough).  
Alternative outcomes: premature_mortality or poor_mental_health.

* Model 3 — GLM for proportion outcomes
Purpose: model proportion outcomes with appropriate mean–variance relationship.
Example:  
glm(poor_mental_health_prop ~ park_area_density + poverty_rate + education_level, family = quasibinomial(link = "logit")).
We will report effect sizes as odds ratios with CIs.

* Model 4 — Mixed-effects model (random intercept by borough)
Purpose: account for geographic clustering/heterogeneity.
Example:  
obesity_rate ~ park_area_per_capita + poverty_rate + education_level + (1 | borough).
Random intercepts capture unobserved borough-level differences.

* Robustness / Sensitivity
  (i) Alternative green-space definitions (density vs per-capita vs count),
  (ii) Alternate park-type filters,
  (iii) Multicollinearity checks (VIF) and standardized coefficients,

* Diagnostics
Residual–fitted and QQ plots (linearity/normality), heteroskedasticity checks, influence measures, and comparison of AIC/R² across specifications.

Visualization Plan

* Descriptive/EDA: histograms or density plots of key variables; boxplots by borough to show between-borough variability; a correlation heatmap for selected features.

* Associations: scatter plots with linear smooths (green-space metrics vs health outcomes), faceted by borough to highlight heterogeneity.

* Spatial context: choropleth maps for (a) green-space indicators and (b) health outcomes, presented side-by-side for visual comparison.

* Model results: coefficient plots (point estimates with 95% CIs) and fitted-vs-observed plots; concise tables summarizing key effects.


### Coding Challenges

When implementing this analytic plan, several technical and conceptual challenges are likely to arise across data preparation, modeling, diagnostics, and visualization.

Data preparation will probably be the first and most time-consuming stage. Public health and green-space data often come in different spatial or administrative resolutions, such as census tracts, ZIP codes, or boroughs, and reconciling these levels can be tricky. Aggregating data to a common unit of analysis must also handle denominators carefully---park area per capita, per km², or density all require different normalizations. Missing or inconsistent entries are another common issue, we’ll need to decide whether to impute or restrict to complete cases. 

For the modeling stage, each specification brings distinct technical challenges. The baseline OLS models are simple to estimate but may conceal nonlinear relationships or be unduly influenced by outliers. The confounder-controlled multiple OLS models require careful encoding of borough fixed effects and thoughtful interpretation of within-borough contrasts. Socioeconomic predictors are typically correlated, so variance inflation factors will be necessary to monitor multicollinearity. Model comparison using AIC or adjusted R^2 can be complicated by the inclusion of categorical fixed effects. For GLM models, proportion outcomes must be correctly specified, and overdispersion should be checked. In contrast, mixed-effects models often struggle with convergence when borough-level sample sizes are small or predictors are correlated. Properly specifying the random structure is critical for interpreting geographic heterogeneity. 

Finally, reproducibility is a meta-level challenge running through the entire workflow. Managing multiple models and variants can quickly become unwieldy; using a tidy modeling workflow to store and summarize model outputs helps maintain consistency. It’s also important to document all preprocessing and ensure that diagnostics and plots draw from the same dataset used for estimation.
